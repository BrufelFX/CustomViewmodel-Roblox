# CustomViewmodel-Roblox

A simple custom viewmodel is enough to create a folder in the script “Models” and custom model put into the folder and call the function Equip or UnEquip in any local script for example as I gave in ViewmodelLocalScript

viewmodel module script place it in “ReplicatedStorage”
if you want to use ViewmodelLocalScript, place it in “StarterCharacterScripts”.

# THIS SCRIPT WORKS ONLY ON THE CLIENT SIDE
